## Gameplay
Each round consists of the following phases: B2B, Campaigning, Company Growth, Funnel Actions, Acquisitions, and Funnel Subjects.
Lastly there is a cleanup phase.
Each phase is initiated by the starting player and continues clockwise around the table.
After each round the role of starting player will transfer to the player to the current starting player's immediate right (one spot counter-clockwise).

### B2B Phase
In the Business To Business phase the players land deals with companies wanting to run clinical trials.
Each player may acquire up to 1 new deal in this phase.
Beginning with the start player, players select a trial tile to put up for auction.
Once an auction is complete, the winner of the auction will not be able to participate in any further auctions this round.
If the player whose turn it is has won an auction, play passes to the next player around the table.
A player may choose to pass during an auction and will be out for the reminder of that auction.
A player may choose to pass instead of putting a trial up for auction, in which case they cannot participate in any further auctions this round.

When putting a trial up for auction, the auctioning player must choose a number no higher than the current trial value.
This is the amount of money the player will receive for running the trial, if he should win the trial now.
All other players in order may bid lower than this number, trying to undercut the current bid.
This way bidding continues around the table until everybody but one player passes.
That player will receive that tile and as much money from the bank as their winning bid.

The initial bid must be equal to the money-value of the tile.
Some tiles have multiple values seperated by a slash.
This indicates the trial owners desperation as time passes.
The number after the slash is multiplied by the amount of black cubes on the tile and added to the initial value, when determining maximum bid.

Once all players have either won a trial tile or passed, this phase is over.

### Campaigning
During campaigning each player, in turn order, decides how much cash to spend on marketing for each of the two diseases.
Each player will, on the turn, place as much money as they feel like on each of the two disease spaces of their playerboard.
This money is considered spent, but is placed here as a reminder of how much each person used.

### Company Growth
In this phase players may buy a single support tile (labcoat or phone).
All support tiles cost 3 coins.

### Funnel Actions
Subjects in the funnel may be subject to medical screenings and motivational calls.
Each player may perform 1 screening per labcoat they own and 1 call per phone they have.

When screening, a player my select 1 subject in the Screening section of their player board and flip their subject disc to the coloured side.
This may be done once per labcoat the player has.

When performing a phone call the player may select 1 subject in the Motivation section of their player board and flip their subject tile to its numbered side.
This may be done once per phone the player has.
When motivating a subject, a player may remove all black cubes from the subject and place 1 green cube unto the subject.

These actions may be performed simultaneouslyl by all players, or in turn depending on player preference.

### Acquisition
Each player will in turn return a 1-value coin from one of their marketing-spaces on their playerboard, to take a corresponding subjects.
When returning teal marketing money players must take a teal patient.
When returning orange marketing money players must take a orange patient.
Players may not look at the patient tile nor the patient disc when taking a patient.
Place the patient into the Onboarding space of the playerboard.

If no more patients exist in the corresponding pool of patients, all remaining marketing money is returned to the supply.
Do not return to the player what they have spent on bad advertisement.

### Funnel Subjects
Each player may now move any subjects on their playerboard to any spot further to that subjects right.
A subject can only move towards the trials, but may skip any steps the players so desire.

When moving a subject to a trial flip its disc and tile if this is not already done.
If the disc matches the trials specification -- disease and colour -- check the subject motivation.
To check motivation roll the Motivation Die and compare this to the subject tile.
If you roll equal to or higher than the number printed, add the subject to the trial.
If not, return the subject to its subject pool.

For each black cube on the subject subtract 1 from your roll.
For each green cube on the subject add 1 to your roll.

If, when moving a subject to a trial, that trial is considered complete, return all the matched subjects to their subject pool and move the trial tile to your stack of completed trials.
Trials come in three different flavours:
* A: Any patient will do, as long as their disease match. Do not roll motivation.
* Q: Patient must match disease and colour. Do not roll motivation.
* R: Patient must match disease and colour and be motivated.

### Cleanup
If the game is not over, perform the following steps:

* Place a black cube on all trials (not completed or failed) in play
* If any trials on the market have more cubes than their indicated amount, remove them from the game. Trials without cube indication does not receive cubes in this step.
* If any trials managed by players have more cubes on them than their time-value, these trials immediately fails. Return their patients to their corresponding stacks.
* Refill the trials market so it again have 6 trials in it.
* Finally N-1 patients to each patient pool, where N is the number of players.

## End of the game
The game will end when 3 of the 4 prestige trials have been either completed or run out of time.
Alternatively the game will end if the trials market cannot be refilled.
The players will sum up all their prestige, and the player with most prestige is the winner.
Prestige for failed projects are counted as negative prestige.
In the case of a tie, the player with the most cash left is the winner.
If there is still a tie, the players share victory.
